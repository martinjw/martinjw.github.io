<h2>SqlServer Queuing</h2>
<p>Published Thursday 13 February 2014</p><article>
<h4>&#160;</h4>
<p>Using a database as a queue is a common requirement. An example is sending emails within a website- it can be slow, error-prone, and you don't want to delay returning a page to the user. So the server processing just queues a request in the database, and a worker process picks it up and tries to execute it.</p>
<p>The real problem is there may be more than one worker process, perhaps running on different servers. By using the table as a queue, they can avoid deadlocks or processing records multiple times.</p>
<p><a href="http://rusanu.com/2010/03/26/using-tables-as-queues/">Comprehensive breakdown of queuing including heap queues, FIFO and LIFO.</a></p>  <h5>Table</h5>
<p>Let's have a [Created] column, and an [IsProcessed] column. Alternatively we could just delete the rows when they are processed.</p>  <pre>CREATE TABLE [dbo].[EmailRequests](
	[Id] [int] IDENTITY(1,1) NOT NULL,
	[EmailAddress] [nvarchar](250) NOT NULL,
	[Subject] [nvarchar](50) NOT NULL,
	[Body] [nvarchar](500) NOT NULL,
	[IsProcessed] [bit] NOT NULL,
	[Created] [datetime] NOT NULL,
 CONSTRAINT [PK_EmailRequests] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED (	[Id] ASC )
)</pre>


<p>The INSERT is just a normal INSERT.</p>

<pre>INSERT INTO [EmailRequests]
           ([EmailAddress],[Subject],[Body],[IsProcessed],[Created])
     VALUES
           ('test@email.com','Hello','Spam spam spam',0,CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)</pre>

<h5>Dequeue</h5>


<p>This is a FIFO queue, but the order isn't strict (see <a href="http://rusanu.com/2010/03/26/using-tables-as-queues/">this explanation</a>)</p>

<ul>
  <li>The lock hints mean lock the row (as normal), but skip any existing locks (so avoiding deadlocks) </li>

  <li>The OUTPUT clause with the CTE makes it all a single atomic operation </li>

  <li>The inserted identifier includes UPDATEs and INSERTs. For DELETEs, there is a deleted identifier, </li>
</ul>

<pre>with cte as (
 select top(1) [Id], [IsProcessed], [EmailAddress], [Subject], [Body]
 from [EmailRequests] with (ROWLOCK, READPAST)
 where [IsProcessed]= 0
 order by [Created]
)
update cte
	set [IsProcessed] = 1
	output inserted.[Id], inserted.[EmailAddress], inserted.[Subject], inserted.[Body]</pre>


<p>&#160;</p>


<p>To make this a bit more realistic, you could add a [IsEmailSent] column, updated when the emailing succeeds. Only one worker de-queued the record and has the [Id] so this is straightforward. Then you need a process for dealing with records that are [IsProcessed] but not [IsEmailSent] (dequeued, but the email failed). You might retry (in which case, add a [RetryCount] counter up to a maximum), or have a manual alert (the email address is bogus, etc etc).</p>


<p>&#160;</p>


<p>Remember resetting [IsProcessed] to 0 or infinitely retrying may poison the queue!</p>
