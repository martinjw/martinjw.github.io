<h2>TF31003: Windows 8 vs Team Foundation Service</h2>
<p>Published Friday 30 November 2012</p><article>

<p>At work I can happily connect to my Azure-hosted Team Foundation Service. But I couldn't do it from home. It says it is looking up identity providers, but the live.com logon screen never shows up. I just see the dreaded TFS31003 error ("<em>Either you have not entered the necessary credentials or your user account does not have permission to connect to Team Foundation Server </em>").</p>
<p>My home machines are Windows 8 and linked to my personal LiveIDs, not my work logon. Windows 8 likes to connect to lots of Skydrive and lots of other services, storing all those credentials. And Visual Studio picks those rather than allow me to add a new one. Deleting entries in the Windows credentials store didn't work.</p>
<p>How can I force Visual Studio to select the right logon?</p>
<p>In Visual Studio, View&gt;Other Windows&gt;Web Browser</p>
<p>In the browser, go to live.com, and log on.</p>

<p>On mine it automatically logged on with another of my logons, so I signed off, and then signed back in with the correct one.</p>
<p>Now when I tried to connect to the TFS service address, it works.</p>
