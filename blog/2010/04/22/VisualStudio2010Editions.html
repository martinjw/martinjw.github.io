<h2>Visual Studio 2010 editions</h2>
<p>Published Thursday 22 April 2010</p><article>
Visual Studio 2010 has simplified the numbers of editions<br />
Good riddance to the Visual Studio 2008 mess of Team System x / Team Suite confusion.<br />
<br />
But what's in each version? <br />

<br />
<br />
<b>Express</b><br />
What's missing: Unit testing (use NUnit), add ins (not even Coderush Express), source control integration (use file system level tortoiseSVN).<br />
Good for: simple home use, and even then a serious developer will find it lacking (esp no Resharpher/ CodeRush)<br />
<br />
<b>Professional</b><br />
Has addins, MsTest unit testing, TFS integration. <br />
The basic business version. In TFS, checkin policies enforcing code analysis are widely used, but you just can't use it here. You can only use standalone FXCop.<br />
<br />
<b>Premium</b><br />
Has Code analysis (use standalone FXcop), code coverage, coded UI Tests, test impact analysis (new feature, looks promising).<br />
I expect this will be the most common business version, certainly most useful for larger teams. <br />
But it's 5 times the price of Professional for features which aren't that exciting. <br />
<br />
<b>Ultimate</b><br />
Adds historical debugging (intellitrace, it rocks), load tests, manual tests (look good), uml diagrams (really nice), architecture explorer. <br />
The big problem: it's over $11000 / euro12800. Ten times the price of Professional and twice Premium. Very few organisations are big enough to buy that. <br />
<br />
Ultimate has some great features, but it's just too expensive. And Premium looks a little thin for such a big price jump. <br />
For the next version, I hope Microsoft will drop a few features from Ultimate to Premium or even Pro. <br />
<br />
I reckon intelliTrace and UML diagrams are the ones which would really gain some interest if more people could get their hands on them. <br />
