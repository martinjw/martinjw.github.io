<h2>Database Schema Reader</h2>
<p>Published Monday 01 November 2010</p><article>

<p>A long time ago I wrote my <a href="http://www.martinwilley.com/net/code/dbschema/dbschema.html" target="_blank">database schema reader</a>. It was 2005, .Net 2.0 was just out and I was learning about the new features. .Net 2.0's ADO DbProviderFactory had a nice idea, GetSchema, to get database independent schema information. But the GetSchema collections were slightly different for each database, and they were data tables. So I wrote a simple facade over them to get proper classes.</p>
<p>Initially I used it to generate CRUD stored procedures, and then to generate data access code, even including NHibernate mappings. I even did some (simple) database conversions. All this was quite icky, and each time I did the code-gen a different way, but the core facade worked well.</p>

<p>After getting a couple of queries about <a href="http://www.martinwilley.com/net/code/dbschema/databaseschema.html" target="_blank">the extracts I'd already posted</a>, I thought I might as well put up the entire source code. So here's <a href="http://dbschemareader.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">the codeplex project</a> with the source code, and even some basic SQL code-gen.</p>
<p>I picked Codeplex just because it's more .Net-centric than Google code or github, plus I'm more familiar with TFS and Subversion source control. It was pretty easy. I don't expect many downloads (if any!), but maybe a couple of people can steal the relevant bits of source code.</p>
