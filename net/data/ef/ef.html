<h2>Entity Framework</h2>
<ul>
<li>EF v1 was released in 2008, and everybody hated it</li>
<li>EF v4 (there was no v2 or v3) was released in 2010 (now old, deprecated). See <a href="efedmx.html">EF data/model first</a>, the original EF 4 database/model first approach, with edmx designer and "Entity SQL"</li>
<li>EF v4.1 was released in 2011 and included <a href="efcodefirst.html">Code First</a>.<br />
EF v6 was released in 2013.</li>
<li><a href="efcore1.html">EF Core v1</a> (originally "EF v7") was released in 2016 (NB: EF v6 was still supported and recommended for most scenarios)</li>
<li><a href="../../code/nhibernate/index.html">NHibernate</a> is the other big ORM. It's more mature than EF Code First, but the legacy is confusing (multiple ways of  mapping, old HQL/Criteria style queries)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net">Dapper</a> is a minimal ADO wrapper ("micro-ORM" without the R). For optimized SQL, but you can do native SQL anyway within EF and NHibernate.</li>
<li>There are intermediates between heavy ORMs like EF/NHib and raw ADO/Dapper, like PetaPoco and SimpleData. There are also older mappers like Castle ActiveRecord.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>IMHO for most purposes, EF Code First is the easiest to get up and running, and then refine and upgrade</li>
<li>NHibernate is still better for more complex requirements and scaling</li>
<li>For optimized low-level stuff, just use Dapper/ADO</li>
</ul>
